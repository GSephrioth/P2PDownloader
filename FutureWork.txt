\f0\fs24 \cf0 Currently all peers are connected to each other, which results in a poor scalability.\
I plan to change such mechanism into a neighborhood transfer mechanism.\
\
For downloading and obtaining the file, still use point to point connection by RMI with given IP address and port number.\
\
For synchronization between servers, server thread of local thread only check the file dictionary in neighborhood servers, only send local file dictionary changes to neighborhood servers.\
\
Think about optimize the synchronization based on logical topology.}
